## Basic Operations

Mathematical Operations:

Solve this using mathematical operations. (+, -, *, / , etc)

```js
var amount = 2080;
// Define a new variable and store the value that is 80 less then the value of amount.

// Define a new variable and store the value that is 200 more then the value of amount.

// Define a new variable and store the value that is 4 times the value of amount.

// Define a new variable and store the reminder when the value of amount is  divided by 21.
```

Logical Operation:

Solve this using logical operations. (<, >, &&, ||)

```js
var johnAge = 45;
var markAge = 35;

// Check who is older eithe John or Mark
// Check who is younger
// Check if their age is equal
// Create a new variable and assign the age of john to new variable.
// Check if john is equal to or greater then mark.
// Check if john is less then or equal to mark.

// Calculate the average age of john and mark and assign to a new variable.
